/* Usage Tracker — v0.25.0
 * v0.25.0: Layout overhaul + drill-down + demo polish. Five things
 *   shipped together:
 *   1. Clickable stat tiles. Count-based tiles (Tracked / Active /
 *      Inventory / Finished) switch the Table view + apply that filter.
 *      Amount-based tiles (Total spend / YTD / Last 30 days) open a new
 *      stat-detail modal listing each product's contribution to the
 *      total, sorted descending. Clicking a row in the modal opens that
 *      product's Edit dialog. YTD daily cost stays non-clickable (it's a
 *      category-rate sum, not a per-product breakdown).
 *   2. Display controls moved. Currency / Pre-tax / Density / Columns
 *      now live inside view-table directly above the search bar, instead
 *      of at the top of the page. Frees the page top for the stats bar
 *      (the more important UI). Density + Columns stay hidden on mobile
 *      per v0.17.5.
 *   3. Demo banner reworked. Was a soft primary-tinted in-page panel;
 *      now fixed at top of the viewport in solid primary blue with white
 *      text, like a real "you're in a mode" indicator. body.is-demo-mode
 *      adds top padding (44px desktop / 64px mobile) so the fixed banner
 *      doesn't overlay the site header.
 *   4. Demo data fully fictional. DEMO_PRODUCTS no longer references
 *      real consumer brands — replaced with made-up names: FreshGuard
 *      / BrightSmile / ScalpClear / MintGlide / DentalGuard / GumShield.
 *      Reserved UPC range (000000-prefix) for the demo entries so they
 *      can't collide with real products. "Demo user" / card 0000 for
 *      buyer/card fields. Reads as clearly synthetic.
 *   5. Thumb size HTML attrs. Added width/height to the desktop and
 *      mobile thumb img tags so the browser sizes them correctly even
 *      if the SW is serving a stale CSS. Belt-and-suspenders against
 *      the "thumb renders at natural 64px" failure mode.
 * v0.24.1: Two follow-ups to v0.24.0:
 *   1. Mobile card layout: thumb moved out of mc-head (where it sat at
 *      32px stacked above the wrapping title as its own visual block)
 *      and into a new .mc-title-row that puts it inline with the title
 *      at 22px (matches the title's line-height). Reads as part of the
 *      title, not a separate banner. mc-head now just contains the
 *      product-type chip and status pill.
 *   2. Backfill report split by reason. Was "Updated N, skipped M" with
 *      no explanation. Now categorizes M into: "not found in UPC database"
 *      (the actionable signal — manual Brand entry is the fix), "matched
 *      but no new data" (rare; database has the UPC but no brand/image
 *      string for it), and "errors" (network/auth/proxy failures). Skipped
 *      products are also console.groupCollapsed'd with names + UPCs so a
 *      future debug session can spot patterns (typed UPCs, store brands).
 *      Helps clarify the v0.24.0 "I clicked backfill but 15 are still
 *      skipped" case — those are UPCs that genuinely aren't in
 *      UPCitemdb + OpenFoodFacts.
 * v0.24.0: Backfill + logo improvements for products missing brand/image
 *   data. Two fixes for "I clicked Backfill and these products STILL don't
 *   have logos":
 *   1. Backfill now uses `forceFresh: true` on each lookup so cached
 *      misses (UPC was looked up once, came back empty, got cached as
 *      `source: 'miss'`) get retried instead of permanently skipped. The
 *      v0.18.2 backfill honored those cached misses, which meant any
 *      product that lost its first lookup to a rate-limit or network blip
 *      stayed permanently un-backfilled regardless of how many times the
 *      user clicked.
 *   2. brandToDomain got a real punctuation + alias pass. The MVP
 *      heuristic ("Head & Shoulders" → strip ampersand → "headshoulders.com")
 *      didn't match real domains. Now: " & " → "and" before stripping,
 *      apostrophes + periods stripped, hyphens preserved, plus a
 *      BRAND_ALIASES table for the 15 personal-care brands where the
 *      synthesized domain genuinely doesn't match the real site (P&G,
 *      St. Ives, L'Oréal, Oral-B variants, etc.). Logo coverage should
 *      now hit a lot more of the "brand was captured but no logo
 *      appeared" cases.
 * v0.23.2: Pin the demo link to a site footer. Small footer at the
 *   bottom of main-wrap with a "Try the demo →" link so signed-in users
 *   have an easy share-with-a-friend path without hunting through
 *   Settings. Hidden in demo mode (body.is-demo-mode .site-footer) since
 *   the demo banner already pins an Exit link. Auth-gate's existing
 *   "Or try the demo first" link is unchanged.
 * v0.23.1: Plug a privacy leak in the mirror. The v0.23.0 sw.js comment
 *   block named both the primary and secondary repos in prose ("The
 *   mirror workflow in primary/usage copies this file unchanged
 *   to secondary/dev/usage/sw.js"). The existing 3-pass sed scrub only
 *   caught rizzo.cc references — bare account names slipped through.
 *   Two-part fix: rewrote the comment to use generic language (primary
 *   / secondary deployment), AND added pass 4 + 5 to the workflow that
 *   rewrite bare "primary" → "primary" and "secondary" → "secondary"
 *   as defense-in-depth so a future contributor can't accidentally
 *   re-introduce the leak. SHELL_VERSION bumped to v0.23.1 so the SW
 *   re-caches the cleaned-up shell on next visit.
 * v0.23.0: PWA installability. New service worker at `sw.js` enables the
 *   `beforeinstallprompt` event on Chrome / Edge / Android Chrome — those
 *   browsers require an active SW with a fetch handler before they'll
 *   surface the install banner. The SW takes a cache-first strategy for
 *   the same-origin shell (HTML / CSS / JS / icons / manifest), with
 *   passthrough for cross-origin requests (Firebase, Chart.js, FDA,
 *   logo.dev, Apps Script proxy) so live data stays live. SHELL_VERSION
 *   constant in sw.js drives cache invalidation — bumped on each release
 *   that touches the shell. Bonus: ?demo=1 now works fully offline once
 *   the shell is cached, since demo doesn't need network. New "Install
 *   app" button in the user-chip toolbar listens for the deferred prompt
 *   event and surfaces only when the browser deems the app installable
 *   AND it's not already running standalone. iOS Safari users still
 *   add-to-home via the share menu (Safari doesn't fire beforeinstallprompt).
 *   SW registration is deferred via requestIdleCallback so it doesn't
 *   compete with first-paint resource fetches.
 * v0.22.1: Hide the Dashboard tab on mobile. Charts don't render
 *   usefully at narrow widths — six Chart.js canvases compress into
 *   illegible cramped boxes. Hiding the tab also keeps the lazy-loaded
 *   Chart.js bundle (~200KB) from ever fetching on mobile-only sessions.
 *   CSS-only change via `@media (max-width: 720px) { .view-tab
 *   [data-view="dashboard"] { display: none } }`. Desktop is unchanged.
 * v0.22.0: Demo mode via `?demo=1` URL flag. Bypasses Firebase Auth,
 *   loads 10 hardcoded sample products covering Underarm / Toothpaste /
 *   Shampoo / Toothbrush / Floss with a realistic active/inventory/
 *   finished mix and bundle relationships so the dashboard charts +
 *   reorder reminders fire on the sample data. Save / Delete /
 *   saveCustomTypes intercept demo mode to be in-memory no-ops with
 *   a "Demo mode — changes only last for this session" toast. Recall
 *   API check skipped in demo (don't burn quota / pollute UI with real
 *   recalls for fictional products). Body.is-demo-mode + a visible
 *   banner at the top of main-wrap keep the demo state obvious.
 *   "Sign out" button relabels to "Exit demo" and strips ?demo=1 from
 *   the URL on click. Auth-gate page gets a low-key "Or try the demo"
 *   link below the Google sign-in CTA.
 * v0.21.0: Possible-recall alerts (Minimal v1, client-side). New banner
 *   at the top of the page surfaces any open FDA recalls for brands in
 *   the user's tracked products. Architecture: brand-match query against
 *   `api.fda.gov/drug/enforcement.json` per unique brand, filter to
 *   Ongoing/Pending status + <=12mo old, dedupe by recall_number, sort
 *   by severity (Class I → II → III). Results cached 24h in
 *   `usage.recallCheck.v1`. Dismissals tracked in `usage.recallDismissed.v1`
 *   (Set of recall_numbers, persists across reloads). Brand-only matching
 *   is noisy — the banner header explicitly says "verify on the FDA
 *   page before acting." No email side (that's the future v2 server-side
 *   cron). Falls through silently if FDA is unreachable.
 * v0.20.1: One-tap Start button for inventory products. Mirror of the
 *   v0.14.1 Finish flow: each inventory row (desktop + mobile) gets a
 *   Start button. Clicking it opens a tiny dialog with today's date
 *   pre-filled; confirming saves the product with that startDate set,
 *   flipping it from inventory → active. Date input is bounded by
 *   purchaseDate (can't start using before you bought it) and today
 *   (can't start in the future). Saves the user from opening the full
 *   Edit dialog just to set one date. Mobile primary-blue button color
 *   to differentiate from Finish's success-green ("begin" vs "complete").
 * v0.20.0: User-facing changelog ("What's new" modal). Clicking the
 *   version chip in the header opens a modal with filter tabs (All /
 *   New feature / Improvement / Fix), a vertical timeline of past
 *   entries, and short plain-English bodies for each. New CHANGELOG
 *   const in this file holds the entries — separate from the README
 *   changelog (which is verbose / technical) so user-facing copy can
 *   stay short and action-oriented. Backfilled with ~11 entries
 *   covering v0.14.1 → v0.20.0. Status pills follow theme: NEW =
 *   primary blue, Improvement = success green, Fix = amber. Unread
 *   indicator: a small primary-blue dot on the version chip when the
 *   latest entry's version > localStorage.lastChangelogVersionSeen.
 *   Dot clears the moment the user opens the modal. Mobile-friendly
 *   layout with a stacked filter strip + tighter card padding.
 * v0.19.0: Catalog expansion. Six new seed product types (Conditioner,
 *   Razor, Skincare, Makeup, Feminine hygiene, Intimate) and 15 seed
 *   stores (Amazon, Target, Walmart, Costco, Sam's Club, Walgreens, CVS,
 *   Kroger, Jewel-Osco, Mariano's, Meijer, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods,
 *   Publix, Wegmans) pre-populated in the Add-product dropdowns.
 *   Categorization rules in guessProductTypeFromCategory extended so UPC
 *   auto-fill maps related keywords to the new types (e.g. "moisturizer"
 *   → Skincare, "tampon" → Feminine hygiene, "lipstick" → Makeup).
 *   Custom types and the user's own past store entries are still
 *   merged in, so nothing existing is lost.
 * v0.18.2: Polish pass — three small things shipped together.
 *   1. Pre-tax display defaults ON for users who haven't set a preference.
 *      Anyone who has explicitly toggled either direction keeps their
 *      choice (the localStorage value is non-null for them).
 *   2. New "Backfill brand & images" button in the Settings dialog. Walks
 *      the product list, finds anything missing brand or imageUrl, and
 *      runs each through the UPC lookup to fill in whatever the database
 *      knows. Fields the user has already set are never overwritten.
 *      Polite 300ms delay between lookups so we don't hammer the API.
 *   3. og:url, og:image, twitter:image, and a new canonical link tag now
 *      point at dev.rizzo.cc/usage across index.html / share.html /
 *      404.html. Search engines and social-media crawlers now treat
 *      dev.rizzo.cc as the source-of-truth even when the page is reached
 *      via the secondary rizzo.cc deployment.
 * v0.18.1: Tighten the mirror's privacy scrub. The v0.18.0 comment header
 *   itself mentioned the source-hostname by name in descriptive prose
 *   ("the rizzo.cc URL keeps working", etc.), which slipped through the
 *   v0.18.0 sed pass since the pass only rewrote full-hostname matches.
 *   Rephrased the header to use generic language (primary deployment /
 *   secondary deployment), AND beefed up the workflow sed to also catch
 *   bare "rizzo.cc" → "rizzo.cc" as defense-in-depth so future authors
 *   can't accidentally re-introduce the leak.
 * v0.18.0: Secondary deployment at dev.rizzo.cc/usage. The primary URL
 *   keeps working as the source-of-truth; a GitHub Action mirror at
 *   .github/workflows/mirror-to-dev.yml syncs the static files into a
 *   /usage subfolder of a second repo on every push to main. Privacy
 *   measures bake the account separation into the mirror: README.md /
 *   .github / firestore.rules excluded from the copy, sed rewrites any
 *   remaining primary-URL refs in HTML/JS to the secondary URL during
 *   the sync, and commit messages on the target repo are generic
 *   ("Update /usage") with github-actions[bot] as the author. Also
 *   scrubbed the og-image: the URL text rendered at the bottom-right
 *   of the share card is gone (was leaking the primary origin into
 *   every Discord/Slack/Twitter preview), so the same OG card works
 *   at any deployment URL. og-image.svg edited at the source,
 *   og-image.png re-rendered via sharp-cli.
 * v0.17.8: PageSpeed pass round 2 — lazy-load Chart.js. The ~200KB Chart
 *   bundle was eagerly imported at the top of app.js even though it's
 *   only used on the Dashboard tab + the per-row price-history dialog.
 *   Replaced the top-level import with `let Chart = null; let _chartLoadPromise
 *   = null;` and a new `ensureChart()` async helper that imports + registers
 *   on first call and caches the module afterward. `renderDashboard` is now
 *   async and awaits ensureChart before drawing the 6 dashboard charts;
 *   `renderPriceHistoryChart` similarly awaits before instantiating its
 *   line chart. Failed imports null out the cached promise so the next
 *   call retries fresh. Same lazy pattern already used for html2canvas
 *   (PNG export) and @zxing/browser (UPC scanner).
 * v0.17.7: PageSpeed pass round 1 (HTML hints, no JS changes). Added
 *   preconnect to gstatic (Firebase modules) and jsdelivr (Chart.js +
 *   later html2canvas/zxing) so DNS + TLS handshake starts in parallel
 *   with HTML parse. dns-prefetch for img.logo.dev (brand logos, post-
 *   auth) and identitytoolkit.googleapis.com (sign-in). color-scheme:
 *   light meta so browsers don't transiently apply dark-mode styling
 *   to form controls during initial paint. fetchpriority="high" +
 *   decoding="async" on the two LCP-candidate favicon.svg refs (header
 *   brand 36px and auth-card 56px) so the browser prioritizes them over
 *   deferred resources and decodes off the main thread. v0.17.8 will be
 *   the bigger lazy-Chart.js refactor.
 * v0.17.6: New Finished tab in the row-filter bar (alongside All / Active /
 *   Inventory). Filters to products with an end date set — useful for
 *   sorting through history (e.g. find longest-lasting toothpaste, see
 *   total spend on items you've actually used up). Persists in
 *   usage.tableFilter.v1 like the others. Empty-state message guides the
 *   user toward the Finish button on active rows.
 * v0.17.5: Hide Density + Columns controls on mobile. Both only affect the
 *   desktop table (the @media <=720px block flips .products to display:block
 *   + hides every desktop td except .mobile-card-cell, so a Compact density
 *   or a hidden Cost column has nothing to act on). The toggles were just
 *   visual noise on phones. Currency and Pre-tax stay visible — those
 *   affect numbers in the mobile cards too.
 * v0.17.4: Bundle-aware cost UI in the Add/Edit dialog. The cost field's
 *   schema treats `cost` as the FULL bundle price (allocatedCost = cost
 *   / bundleSize), but the static label "Cost (pre-tax)" never said so —
 *   easy to enter the per-item price by mistake and end up undercounting
 *   spend by a factor of bundleSize. When bundleStatus is checked, the
 *   label rebrands to "Bundle total cost (pre-tax)" and a live helper
 *   line below the input shows the per-item derivation as you type:
 *   "Per-item cost: $3.50 each." Updates on every change to bundleSize
 *   or cost. The bundle chip in the desktop table row also gets the
 *   per-item cost in its hover tooltip ("1 of 2 — $3.50 per item") for
 *   confirmation without opening the row. No data-model changes — just
 *   transparency over the existing math.
 * v0.17.3: Mobile UPC field fix. The input + Look up + Scan trio
 *   couldn't all fit on one line at narrow widths and Scan was getting
 *   pushed past the right edge, forcing horizontal scroll inside the
 *   dialog. Mobile flex-wrap rule: input takes the full first row;
 *   the two buttons share the second row equally.
 * v0.17.2: Mobile regression fix. v0.17.1's flex-wrap rule on
 *   .actions-cell had higher specificity than the mobile-block
 *   `.products tbody td { display: none }` rule, so on mobile the
 *   desktop action buttons were rendering on top of the mobile card —
 *   leading to a duplicate set of Edit/Duplicate/etc. buttons stacked
 *   above the card's own button row. Fixed by scoping both v0.17.1
 *   rules (name-wrap + actions-flex) inside @media (min-width: 721px)
 *   so they only apply on desktop. Mobile cards are unchanged.
 * v0.17.1: Two table tweaks following the v0.17.0 consolidation:
 *   - Long product names now wrap onto multiple lines instead of forcing
 *     the Name column wider. The cell caps at 280px and word-breaks on
 *     overflow so a 70-char SKU title fills 2-3 lines vertically rather
 *     than one very wide horizontal line.
 *   - Row-action buttons (Edit / Finish / Duplicate / History / Share /
 *     Delete) are now flex-wrap'd. When the cell is narrow they stack
 *     into a second row instead of forcing horizontal scroll. The row
 *     is usually already 2 lines tall thanks to the wrapping name, so
 *     stacking buttons doesn't add overall row height.
 * v0.17.0: Desktop table consolidation pass. Four changes shipped together:
 *   1. STORE + BUYER + CARD merged into a single BOUGHT BY column. Each
 *      piece keeps its own filter-chip behavior; missing pieces are
 *      skipped. Sort by BOUGHT BY orders by store first, then buyer,
 *      then card. Saves two columns of horizontal width.
 *   2. New Density toggle (Comfortable / Compact) in the display-controls
 *      bar. Compact tightens row padding and shrinks the table font for
 *      ~15% more rows per screen. Persists per browser at
 *      usage.density.v1.
 *   3. NOTES column auto-hides when nothing in the current view has any
 *      note text. Manual columns preference still applies on top.
 *   4. New Columns dropdown lets the user toggle visibility of any
 *      non-essential column (everything except NAME and ACTIONS). State
 *      persists at usage.columns.v1; "Reset" clears the override and
 *      shows everything.
 *   Bundle siblings panel colspan adjusted 19 → 17 to match the new
 *   total column count (16 desktop + 1 mobile).
 * v0.16.1: $/unit and $/day columns now show 2 decimal places instead of 4.
 *   The 4-decimal precision was forcing horizontal table scrolling on
 *   reasonable-sized monitors, and at personal-tracker scale ($1-2 per oz,
 *   a few cents per day) the extra digits were noise rather than signal.
 *   Affects table cells, dashboard cards, mobile card subtitles, chart
 *   axes/tooltips, trends-panel insight sentences, and PNG export labels —
 *   wherever moneyFine() is called. (moneyFine and money now produce
 *   identical output; left as separate functions for now to keep the
 *   diff minimal.)
 * v0.16.0: Email reorder reminders. New Settings dialog (in the user-chip
 *   toolbar) toggles a daily digest email — the usage-worker Cloudflare
 *   Worker reads /users/{uid}/meta/emailPrefs every morning, computes which
 *   actives are at >=85% of their type's average lifespan, and sends one
 *   email through Resend (max one per week so persistent reminders don't
 *   spam). Email defaults to the signed-in Google account; an override
 *   field lets the user point reminders elsewhere. The in-app reorder
 *   reminders panel is unchanged — the email is just a push version of
 *   the same algorithm.
 * v0.15.5: Mobile card actions row wraps + buttons size to content.
 *   Duplicate button text was wrapping to 2 lines (broken centering,
 *   stretched height) because min-width:64 + padding:16 couldn't fit the
 *   9-char "Duplicate" label. Dropped min-width, allow flex-wrap.
 * v0.15.4: UPC lookup auto-fill now parses size from the product TITLE
 *   when item.size is empty (which is common — UPCitemdb's dedicated size
 *   field is unreliable). New findSizeInString helper scans for
 *   "<num> <unit>" patterns and uses the last match (titles typically end
 *   with the size). Verified against real titles.
 * v0.15.3: Bug fixes + UX polish.
 *   - Fixed: Duplicate of a bundled product was inheriting the source's
 *     bundleId, causing "Position N is already taken" when the user added
 *     a separate physical bundle. Duplicate now starts a fresh bundleId.
 *   - Fixed: toast notifications appeared UNDER modal dialogs because the
 *     dialog top-layer beats CSS z-index. Toast is now a <dialog>.show()
 *     so it lives in the same top layer.
 *   - Fixed: lookupAndOfferUpc was overwriting lookupUpc's specific error
 *     messages with generic "No match" — the user couldn't see what
 *     actually failed. Preserves the specific message now.
 *   - UPC fetch: cache: 'no-store' + console diagnostics to surface what
 *     the proxy actually returned when lookups appear to fail.
 *   - Desktop type chips now color-coded per category (matches mobile).
 *   - Share + PNG combined into one Share button → dialog has both
 *     options (link + PNG export).
 *   - Size auto-decimal on blur for oz/lb/etc.
 * v0.15.2: Brand company logos via logo.dev. Same publishable token used in
 *   the stocks repo. New `brand` field captured from UPCitemdb (and editable
 *   in the dialog). Renders as a circular logo icon in the desktop name
 *   cell, mobile card head, and Edit dialog preview. Falls back to the UPC
 *   product image when no brand is set; both can fail load and self-hide.
 * v0.15.1: Bug fixes + rolling 30-day cost + mobile polish.
 *   - Fixed: purchase date defaulted to tomorrow's UTC date late at night
 *     (off-by-one for negative-offset timezones). Now uses local date.
 *   - Fixed: mobile save button silently failed when HTML5 required
 *     validation tooltips weren't visible. Form is now novalidate; JS
 *     validates explicitly and toasts the specific issue.
 *   - New: rolling 30-day cost stat tile. Sums each tracked product's
 *     proportional cost contribution to the [today-30, today] window.
 *   - New: manual "Look up" button on UPC field bypasses cache so a past
 *     failed lookup can be retried fresh.
 *   - Mobile: "Where" row split into separate Size / Store / Buyer / Card
 *     rows for better visual rhythm and tappability.
 *   - Edit dialog: shows the product image thumbnail near the UPC field
 *     when imageUrl is set.
 * v0.15.0: Favorites — new top-level view alongside Table / Dashboard /
 *   Activity. Catalog of products you remember/liked but aren't necessarily
 *   tracking. Cross-references with tracked products by UPC for "last used /
 *   times used." Doesn't affect any stats, charts, reminders, or trends.
 *   "Track new" button on each favorite pre-fills the Add dialog so you can
 *   start tracking a new instance of a remembered product in one tap.
 * v0.14.4: Full favicon coverage — SVG (modern), 32px PNG fallback,
 *   180px apple-touch-icon, 192/512 PNGs for Android, manifest.webmanifest
 *   so the app is installable as a PWA, theme-color meta tag for mobile
 *   browser chrome.
 * v0.14.3: PNG og-image alongside the SVG (Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn
 *   reject SVG OG images). Added og:url + og:locale on share/404 too.
 * v0.14.2: Honest $/day math. Per-category rate now = total spend on that
 *   category / span its products covered (was sum-of-per-product-rates which
 *   double-counted sequential products of the same type — two $5 items used
 *   over 30 consecutive days now correctly shows as $0.33/day, not $0.67).
 *   Affects: $/day-by-type chart, YTD daily-cost stat, "highest daily-cost
 *   category" insight in trends panel.
 * v0.14.1: One-tap Finish button on active products. Opens a small dialog
 *   with end-date pre-filled to today; confirm marks the product finished
 *   without going through the full Edit flow.
 * v0.14.0: Search & discovery — live search input above the row-filter tabs
 *   with autocomplete dropdown (keyboard nav: ↑↓ Enter Esc); mobile type
 *   chips bumped in size and color-coded per productType for fast visual
 *   scanning.
 * v0.13.1: Activity log moved from localStorage to Firestore so it syncs
 *   across devices (was per-browser before). One-time migration of legacy
 *   localStorage entries on first run after this version. Cleared via the
 *   Activity page's Clear button now wipes the synced log everywhere.
 * v0.13.0: Open Graph + Twitter Card meta tags so links render as branded
 *   embeds in Slack, Discord, iMessage, Twitter/X, etc. New og-image.svg
 *   at standard 1200x630. share.html and 404.html got tags too.
 * v0.12.0: Multi-currency display. User picks one of 15 common currencies in
 *   the display-controls bar; all $ rendering throughout the app routes
 *   through Intl.NumberFormat with that currency code. Cost-input prefix
 *   updates to the chosen symbol too. Underlying numbers don't convert —
 *   it's a display preference, suitable for personal trackers in one
 *   currency at a time.
 * v0.11.0: Read-only share link. New standalone share.html page renders
 *   a base64-encoded product payload as a clean public card. Share button
 *   per row + mobile card opens a dialog with the link + copy-to-clipboard.
 * v0.10.1: Amazon search now uses productName when available (UPC indexing
 *   on Amazon is too sparse to be reliable). Falls back to UPC only when
 *   no name has been entered.
 * v0.10.0: Reorder reminders panel. Surfaces active products approaching or
 *   past their type's average finished lifespan. Capped at 5 most-urgent;
 *   click to open the product for editing.
 * v0.9.0: "Check current price on Amazon" link below the UPC field in the
 *   Add/Edit dialog. Opens amazon.com/s?k={upc} in a new tab. Visible only
 *   when the UPC is at least 8 digits.
 * v0.8.0: Price history per UPC. When two or more products share the same
 *   UPC (recurring purchases of the same item), a "History" button appears
 *   on each row → modal with line chart of cost over time + entry table
 *   showing each purchase and its delta vs the first.
 * v0.7.23: QoL trio — UPC field autofocus on Add, `n` keyboard shortcut to
 *   open the Add dialog, and a small spinning indicator while a UPC lookup
 *   is in flight.
 * v0.7.22: Mobile filter chips — Type, Buyer, and Card cells in mobile cards
 *   are now tappable filter chips (parity with desktop). Closes the deferred
 *   item from v0.7.10.
 * v0.7.21: Persistent UPC cache in Firestore at /users/{uid}/upcCache/{upc} —
 *   once we've ever resolved a UPC, we never hit a live API for it again.
 *   Misses are cached too so dead UPCs don't keep burning quota. OpenFoodFacts
 *   added as a fallback source when UPCitemdb misses or hits EXCEED_LIMIT.
 * v0.7.20: UPC lookup actually works now. UPCitemdb's /trial endpoint sends
 *   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.upcitemdb.com`, so every fetch
 *   from this site was being browser-blocked silently — that's why "I haven't
 *   had success with it at all" was the user's experience. Routes through a
 *   Google Apps Script web app (server-side, no CORS) the user deployed.
 *   Proper EXCEED_LIMIT handling + more visible error pills.
 * v0.7.19: Custom 404 page (standalone 404.html). GitHub Pages auto-serves
 *   it for any unknown URL; previously visitors saw GitHub's generic black
 *   error page.
 * v0.7.18: Trend panel fix — "highest daily-cost category" insight now uses
 *   finished products only (no preliminary running rates from active items).
 * v0.7.17: Activity log — `createdAt` durable on Firestore products with
 *   one-time backfill migration; per-action log (add/edit/duplicate/delete)
 *   stored in localStorage per uid. New "Activity" tab alongside Table /
 *   Dashboard with 25/50/100/150 page-size selector and a Clear button.
 * v0.7.16: PNG export — per-product card (4:3, 1200×900), dashboard
 *   (4:3, 1600×1200), and overview (5:7 portrait, 1000×1400). Lazy-loaded
 *   html2canvas + custom off-screen templates so the output is a clean
 *   shareable card, not a screenshot of the live UI chrome.
 * v0.7.15: Product thumbnails — UPCitemdb image URL captured on lookup,
 *   stored on the product, rendered as a small square next to the product
 *   name in the desktop table and mobile cards. HTTPS-only (skips http://
 *   to avoid mixed-content blocks); onerror handler removes broken images.
 * v0.7.14: Bundle guardrails — Continue-bundle dropdown shows fill state
 *   (e.g. "2/3" or "3/3 (full)") and disables full bundles. Position
 *   uniqueness is enforced on save with a helpful "try position N" suggestion.
 * v0.7.13: Bundle model refactor — every bundled product now carries a shared
 *   `bundleId` linking siblings from the same multi-pack purchase. Clicking
 *   a bundle chip slides out a panel listing all members. One-time migration
 *   groups legacy rows. Duplicate of a bundled row inherits its bundleId.
 * v0.7.12: Trends panel above the stats bar. Five real-data insight
 *   generators (most-spent category, longest active, recently finished,
 *   top per-day burn, inventory pile-up) shuffled per page load; falls
 *   back to a "Did you know" fact tied to a product type the user owns
 *   when no generator can fire. Cached once per session.
 * v0.7.11: Three new dashboard charts — $/day by product type (burn rate),
 *   purchases by product type (frequency), and combined longest-running
 *   chart (active + past finished, top 10).
 * v0.7.10: Filter chips — Type / Buyer / Card cells in the table are now
 *   clickable; clicking adds an active filter (AND logic across columns).
 *   Active filters render as dismissible chips above the table.
 * v0.7.9: Desktop notes column collapse — long notes render as a chip,
 *   click to expand inline. State shared with mobile expandedCards Set.
 * v0.7.8: Mobile follow-ups — sort dropdown above cards (Newest / Oldest /
 *   Name / Highest $/day / Highest cost), and a "Show more / Show less"
 *   expander per card that hides Where + Notes by default to save vertical
 *   space.
 * v0.7.7: Inventory excluded from spend aggregations. Total spend, YTD spend,
 *   "Top category by spend", "Top store by spend", and the two dashboard
 *   donut/bar charts now skip products without a startDate. Counts
 *   (Active / Inventory / Finished tiles) unchanged.
 * v0.7.6: Pre-tax display toggle (above stats bar). Single chokepoint:
 *   effectiveCost() respects the toggle so every $ value flips together.
 *   "w/ Tax" column hidden via body.pretax-mode CSS class. CSV template
 *   examples switched to Y/N for bundleStatus.
 * v0.7.5: Fix bundle-continue autofilling startDate (broke inventory mode).
 *   Add Duplicate button next to Edit/Delete.
 * v0.7.4: Mobile card view — at <=720px the table flips to a stacked card
 *   layout per product. No more 1400px-min horizontal scroll on phones.
 * v0.7.3: Inventory concept (blank startDate), filter tabs (All/Active/Inventory),
 *   CSV import + CSV/JSON template downloads.
 * v0.7.0–0.7.2: YTD stats, bundle field show/hide, duplicate-with-bundle,
 *   import templates, date TZ fix, decimal formatting.
 * UPC database lookup via UPCitemdb — populates the form after scan/entry
 *   with user confirmation. Free trial endpoint, 100 req/day/IP.
 * UPC camera scanning (ZXing) lazy-loaded on first tap.
 * Phase 5: Dashboard with Chart.js.
 * Phases 3 + 4: Google Sign-In + Firestore per-user storage.
 * Data lives at /users/{uid}/products/{id} and /users/{uid}/meta/customTypes.
 * Products are synced live via onSnapshot so multi-tab/multi-device stays in sync.
 * Dashboard re-renders on every snapshot (and on view switch). */

/* ---------- UPC database lookup (UPCitemdb trial via Apps Script proxy) ----------
 * UPCitemdb's free `/prod/trial/lookup` endpoint serves
 *   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.upcitemdb.com`
 * which means browsers refuse every fetch made from any other origin (including
 * dev.rizzo.cc). v0.7.20 routes the call through a Google Apps Script
 * Web App the user deployed; Apps Script makes the request server-to-server (no
 * CORS), wraps the JSON, and returns it with a permissive `Access-Control-Allow-
 * Origin: *` so the browser is happy.
 *
 * Response shape from proxy is the same as direct UPCitemdb:
 *   { code: "OK", total: N, items: [{ ean, upc, title, brand, category, size, ... }] }
 *   { code: "EXCEED_LIMIT", message: "Rate limit exceeded" }
 *   { code: "INVALID_QUERY" }   // not enough digits etc.
 *
 * Important: UPCitemdb rate-limits the trial endpoint per IP. Apps Script
 * shares its IPs across thousands of users, so the 100/day quota for whichever
 * Google IP we land on is often already burned by other users. Lookups fail
 * with EXCEED_LIMIT in those windows — we surface that clearly. The
 * upcCache below also caches OK results so repeats within a session are free.
